The **old build** of the application can currently be run through ***GUI_Menu.java*** within the ***lms_gui package***. This build of the application is completed, though the GUI is finicky and riddled with bugs.

The **new and improved version** of the application can be run through **MainFrame.java** located within the **new_gui package**. While this version is currently incomplete, the reworked GUI will lead to a more polished and user friendly experience.
