# Software Design (EECS 3311) Culminating Assignment:

The purpose of this culminating assignment was to go through the entire process of designing, implementing, and testing a **YorkU Library Management Java App**. The assignment took the entire term to complete divided among a group of 5 members, and the various stages of software development were spread over the course of 3 deliverables.

**There are 2 primary builds of the application:**
1. The **old build** of the application can currently be run through **GUI_Menu.java** within the **lms_gui package**. This build of the application is completed, though the GUI is finicky and riddled with bugs.
2. The **new and improved version** of the application can be run through **MainFrame.java** located within the **new_gui package**. While this version is currently incomplete, the reworked GUI will lead to a more polished and user friendly experience.

The system proposal and requirements are outlined in great detail below.
- **Not Started - Requirement is going to be ported to the new build in the future.**
- **In Progress - Requirement is actively in the process of being ported to the new build.**
- **On Hold - Requirement progress has been made, but work on porting is being paused to focus on porting other components.**
- **Updated - Requirement has successfully been ported over to the new build.**
- **Completed - Requirement has been implemented and thoroughly tested for bugs in the new build.**

## Comprehensive Application Outline

The **YorkU Library Management Team** is now seeking a new system that can help them provide better online services to their clients (e.g., students, faculty members, non-faculty staff, and visitors). The system is supposed to be a **GUI-based Java application**. The basic requirements of the system (from an interview with their management teams) are as follows:


### Req1: Account Creation and Management (Updated)

Any client should be able to register as a user of the system with a unique/valid email and strong password (i.e., a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols). The system currently allows four types of clients to be registered, i.e., students, faculty members, non-faculty staff, and visitors, while itâ€™s open for new types in the future. If a client registers as a student, a faculty member or a non faculty staff, her/his registration requires a further validation from the management teams.

### Req2: Core Library Functionality (On Hold)
Using the system, any registered client can rent a physical item (i.e., books, magazines, CDs), open an online book, or subscribe to an online university-provided newsletter (e.g. NY Times), etc. Each physical item has 20 copies in the library. Penalty will be applied if a book is overdue (i.e., 0.5$ a day). A user can borrow up to 10 physical items and can keep an item for at most 1 month. All physical items borrowed from the library (books, magazines, CDs) count toward the total of 10 items. A user will lose his borrowing privileges if he has more than 3 items overdue. Books that are 15 days overdue will be considered lost.

### Req3: Account Overview (Updated)
After login, the system should show a list of hardcover books that a user is currently renting and the due date for returning the books. It should also prompt warnings about any book that is not returned yet and it is approaching (less than 24 hours until the due date) or past the due date.

### Req4: Accessing External Subscriptions (Not Started)
The system should allow a user to subscribe and read a paid-for newsletter via its interface, such as the NY Times. This can be done by opening a frame within the system where the NY Times website can be loaded. A user can decide at any time to cancel a newsletter subscription.

### Req5: Searching the Catalogue (Not Started)
A user can search for a book using the application. For a book a user is searching, the app should also show recommendations of similar other books (based on the text similarity of book titles).

### Req6: Unique Faculty Functionality (Not Started)
If a user is a faculty, the app can keep track of the courses the user is teaching and the textbooks the user has previously used. The app then offers notifications to the user when a new edition of the textbook is available. If a textbook is not available, the app should notify the library management team of this, so that they could consult with the user to procure the book.

### Req7: Library Manager Functionality (Not Started)
Each item has a unique identification number and other details including its location in the library and whether the item can be purchased, which will help with the navigation for clients. Managers of the system can add, enable (can be rented), or disable (cannot be rented) an item.

### Req8: Student Functionality (Not Started)
If a user is a student, the textbooks of a given course the student is taking, the app should make virtual copies of the textbooks available to the account of the user for the duration of the course. After that, the app should remove the virtual copies from the student account.

### Req9: Requesting New Books (Not Started)
A user can request for a new book. A request can be of two types, i.e., textbooks for course teaching and self-improvement, etc. Depending on the type, the request will need to be prioritized by the app and the user should be notified of the priority accordingly. Often, textbooks for course teaching will be given higher priority.

### Req10: Special Purchase Agreements (Not Started)
The system could also offer discounted purchases of items via its special agreements with publishers, whose books/DVD are not normally freely available via the usual library management system. For this, the system needs to provide payment options like debit, credit, mobile wallet, etc.

### Req11: Database Implementation (On Hold)
System data is stored in a database, we will use CSV/Excel files to simulate this process.
